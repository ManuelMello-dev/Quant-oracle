## 🔐 Authentication Required

Since this is a Gitpod environment, you need to authenticate. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Use GitHub CLI (Recommended)

Run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd /workspaces/workspaces

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Follow the prompts:
# - Choose: GitHub.com
# - Choose: HTTPS
# - Authenticate: Yes
# - Choose: Login with a web browser
# - Copy the code shown
# - Press Enter to open browser
# - Paste code and authorize

# After authentication, push:
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 2: Use Personal Access Token

1. **Create a token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name: "Gitpod Quant Oracle"
   - Expiration: 30 days
   - Scopes: Check "repo" (all sub-items)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Push with token:**
```bash
cd /workspaces/workspaces

# Use token as password
git push -u origin main

# When prompted:
# Username: ManuelMello-dev
# Password: [paste your token here]
```

### Option 3: Use SSH (If you have SSH keys)

```bash
cd /workspaces/workspaces

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ManuelMello-dev/Quant-oracle.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```
